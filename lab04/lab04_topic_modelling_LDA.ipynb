In this paper, we propose fast and randomized tensor CP decomposition algorithms based on sketching. We build on the idea of count sketches, but introduce many novel ideas which are unique to tensors. We develop novel methods for randomized com- putation of tensor contractions via FFTs, without explicitly forming the tensors. Such tensor contractions are encountered in decomposition methods such as ten- sor power iterations and alternating least squares. We also design novel colliding hashes for symmetric tensors to further save time in computing the sketches. We then combine these sketching ideas with existing whitening and tensor power iter- ative techniques to obtain the fastest algorithm on both sparse and dense tensors. The quality of approximation under our method does not depend on properties such as sparsity, uniformity of elements, etc. We apply the method for topic mod- eling and obtain competitive results.\",\n          \"Many spectral unmixing methods rely on the non-negative decomposition of spectral data onto a dictionary of spectral templates. In particular, state-of-the-art music transcription systems decompose the spectrogram of the input signal onto a dictionary of representative note spectra. The typical measures of fit used to quantify the adequacy of the decomposition compare the data and template entries frequency-wise. As such, small displacements of energy from a frequency bin to another as well as variations of timber can disproportionally harm the fit. We address these issues by means of optimal transportation and propose a new measure of fit that treats the frequency distributions of energy holistically as opposed to frequency-wise. Building on the harmonic nature of sound, the new measure is invariant to shifts of energy to harmonically-related frequencies, as well as to small and local displacements of energy. Equipped with this new measure of fit, the dictionary of note templates can be considerably simplified to a set of Dirac vectors located at the target fundamental frequencies (musical pitch values). This in turns gives ground to a very fast and simple decomposition algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on real musical data.\",\n          \"The problem of  multiclass boosting is considered. A new framework,based on multi-dimensional codewords and predictors is introduced. The optimal set of codewords is derived, and a margin enforcing loss proposed. The resulting risk is minimized by gradient descent on a multidimensional functional space. Two algorithms are proposed: 1) CD-MCBoost, based on coordinate descent, updates one predictor component at a time, 2) GD-MCBoost, based on gradient descent, updates all components jointly. The algorithms differ in the weak learners that they support but are both shown to be 1) Bayes consistent, 2) margin enforcing, and 3) convergent to the global minimum of the risk. They also reduce to AdaBoost when there are only two classes.

Ackley\\nMichael L. Littman\\nCognitive Science Research Group\\nBellcore\\nMorristown, NJ 07960\\n\\nABSTRACT\\nIn associative reinforcement learning, an environment generates input\\nvectors, a learning system generates possible output vectors, and a reinforcement function computes feedback signals from the input-output\\npairs. The task is to discover and remember input-output pairs that\\ngenerate rewards. Especially difficult cases occur when rewards are\\nrare, since the expected time for any algorithm can grow exponentially\\nwith the size of the problem. Nonetheless, if a reinforcement function\\npossesses regularities, and a learning algorithm exploits them, learning\\ntime can be reduced below that of non-generalizing algorithms. This\\npaper describes a neural network algorithm called complementary reinforcement back-propagation (CRBP), and reports simulation results\\non problems designed to offer differing opportunities for generalization.\\n\\n1\\n\\nREINFORCEMENT LEARNING REQUIRES SEARCH\\n\\nReinforcement learning (Sutton, 1984; Barto & Anandan, 1985; Ackley, 1988; Allen,\\n1989) requires more from a learner than does the more familiar supervised learning\\nparadigm. Supervised learning supplies the correct answers to the learner, whereas\\nreinforcement learning requires the learner to discover the correct outputs before\\nthey can be stored. The reinforcement paradigm divides neatly into search and\\nlearning aspects: When rewarded the system makes internal adjustments to learn\\nthe discovered input-output pair; when punished the system makes internal adjustments to search elsewhere.\\n\\n\\fGeneralization and Scaling in Reinforcement Learning\\n1.1\\n\\nMAKING REINFORCEMENT INTO ERROR\\n\\nFollowing work by Anderson (1986) and Williams (1988), we extend the backpropagation algorithm to associative reinforcement learning. Start with a \\\"garden variety\\\" backpropagation network: A vector i of n binary input units propagates\\nthrough zero or more layers of hidden units, ultimately reaching a vector 8 of m\\nsigmoid units, each taking continuous values in the range (0,1). Interpret each 8j\\nas the probability that an associated random bit OJ takes on value 1. Let us call\\nthe continuous, deterministic vector 8 the search vector to distinguish it from the\\nstochastic binary output vector o.\\nGiven an input vector, we forward propagate to produce a search vector 8, and\\nthen perform m independent Bernoulli trials to produce an output vector o. The\\ni - 0 pair is evaluated by the reinforcement function and reward or punishment\\nensues. Suppose reward occurs. We therefore want to make 0 more likely given i.\\nBackpropagation will do just that if we take 0 as the desired target to produce an\\nerror vector (0 - 8) and adjust weights normally.\\nNow suppose punishment occurs, indicating 0 does not correspond with i. By choice\\nof error vector, backpropagation allows us to push the search vector in any direction;\\nwhich way should we go? In absence of problem-specific information, we cannot pick\\nan appropriate direction with certainty. Any decision will involve assumptions. A\\nvery minimal \\\"don't be like 0\\\" assumption-employed in Anderson (1986), Williams\\n(1988), and Ackley (1989)-pushes s directly away from 0 by taking (8 - 0) as the\\nerror vector. A slightly stronger \\\"be like not-o\\\" assumption-employed in Barto &\\nAnandan (1985) and Ackley (1987)-pushes s directly toward the complement of 0\\nby taking ((1 - 0) - 8) as the error vector. Although the two approaches always\\nagree on the signs of the error terms, they differ in magnitudes. In this work,\\nwe explore the second possibility, embodied in an algorithm called complementary\\nreinforcement back-propagation ( CRBP).\\nFigure 1 summarizes the CRBP algorithm. The algorithm in the figure reflects three\\nmodifications to the basic approach just sketched. First, in step 2, instead of using\\nthe 8j'S directly as probabilities, we found it advantageous to \\\"stretch\\\" the values\\nusing a parameter v. When v < 1, it is not necessary for the 8i'S to reach zero or\\none to produce a deterministic output. Second, in step 6, we found it important\\nto use a smaller learning rate for punishment compared to reward. Third, consider\\nstep 7: Another forward propagation is performed, another stochastic binary output vector 0* is generated (using the procedure from step 2), and 0* is compared\\nto o. If they are identical and punishment occurred, or if they are different and\\nreward occurred, then another error vector is generated and another weight update\\nis performed. This loop continues until a different output is generated (in the case\\nof failure) or until the original output is regenerated (in the case of success). This\\nmodification improved performance significantly, and added only a small percentage\\nto the total number of weight updates performed.\\n\\n551\\n\\n\\f552\\n\\nAckley and Littman\\n\\nO.

In this\\nalgorithm, a separate storage location is used for each possible input. This prevents\\nthe memorization of one i - 0 pair from interfering with any other. Similarly,\\nthe selection of a candidate output vector depends only on the slot of the table\\ncorresponding to the given input. The learning speed of T ref depends only on the\\ninput and output dimensionalities and the number of correct outputs associated\\n\\n\\fGeneralization and Scaling in Reinforcement Learning\\n\\nwith each input. When a problem possesses n input bits and n output bits, and\\nthere is only one correct output vector for each input vector, Tre{ runs in about 4n\\ntime (counting each input-output judgment as one.) In such cases one expects to\\ntake at least 2n - 1 just to find one correct i - 0 pair, so exponential time cannot be\\navoided without a priori information. How does a generalizing algorithm such as\\nCRBP compare to Trer?\\n\\n3\\n\\nSIMULATIONS ON SCALABLE PROBLEMS\\n\\nWe have tested CRBP on several simple problems designed to offer varying degrees\\nand types of generalization.

Our theory generates reliable\\npredictions for the evolution in time of training- and generalization errors, and extends the class of mathematically solvable learning processes\\nin large neural networks to those situations where overfitting can occur.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nTools from statistical mechanics have been used successfully over the last decade to study\\nthe dynamics of learning in layered neural networks (for reviews see e.g. [1] or [2]). The\\nsimplest theories result upon assuming the data set to be much larger than the number\\nof weight updates made, which rules out recycling and ensures that any distribution of\\nrelevance will be Gaussian. Unfortunately, both in terms of applications and in terms of\\nmathematical interest, this regime is not the most relevant one. Most complications and\\npeculiarities in the dynamics of learning arise precisely due to data recycling, which creates\\nfor the system the possibility to improve performance by memorizing answers rather than\\nby learning an underlying rule. The dynamics of learning with restricted training sets was\\nfirst studied analytically in [3] (linear learning rules) and [4] (systems with binary weights).\\nThe latter studies were ahead of their time, and did not get the attention they deserved just\\nbecause at that stage even the simpler learning dynamics without data recycling had not\\nyet been studied. More recently attention has moved back to the dynamics of learning\\nin the recycling regime. Some studies aimed at developing a general theory [5, 6, 7],\\nsome at finding exact solutions for special cases [8]. All general theories published so far\\nhave in common that they as yet considered realizable scenario's: the rule to be learned\\nwas implementable by the student, and overfitting could not yet occur. The next hurdle is\\nthat where restricted training sets are combined with unrealizable rules. Again some have\\nturned to non-typical but solvable cases, involving Hebbian rules and noisy [9] or 'reverse\\nwedge' teachers [10]. More recently the cavity method has been used to build a general\\ntheory [11] (as yet for batch learning only). In this paper we generalize the general theory\\nlaunched in [6,5,7], which applies to arbitrary learning rules, to the case of noisy teachers.\\nWe will mirror closely the presentation in [6] (dealing with the simpler case of noise-free\\nteachers), and we refer to [5, 7] for background reading on the ideas behind the formalism.\\n\\n\\fA. C. C. Coolen and C. W. H. Mace\\n\\n238\\n\\n2 Definitions\\nAs in [6, 5] we restrict ourselves for simplicity to perceptrons. A student perceptron operates a linear separation, parametrised by a weight vector J E iRN :\\nS:{-I,I}N -t{-I,I}\\n\\nS(e) = sgn[J?e]\\n\\nIt aims to emulate a teacher o~erating a similar rule, which, however, is characterized by a\\nvariable weight vector BE iR ,drawn at random from a distribution P(B) such as\\nP(B) = >'6[B+B*]\\n\\noutput noise:\\n\\n+ (1->')6[B-B*]\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nP(B) = [~~/NrN e- tN (B-B')2/E2\\n(2)\\nThe parameters>. and ~ control the amount of teacher noise, with the noise-free teacher\\nB = B* recovered in the limits>. -t 0 and ~ -t O. The student modifies J iteratively, using\\nexamples of input vectors which are drawn at random from a fixed (randomly composed)\\nE {-I, I}N with a> 0, and the corresponding\\ntraining set containing p = aN vectors\\nvalues of the teacher outputs. We choose the teacher noise to be consistent, i.e. the answer\\nwill remain the same when that particular question\\ngiven by the teacher to a question\\nre-appears during the learning process. Thus T(e?) = sgn[BJL . e], with p teacher weight\\nvectors BJL, drawn randomly and independently from P(B), and we generalize the training\\nl , B l ), . .. , (e, BP)}. Consistency of teacher noise is natural\\nset accordingly to jj =\\nin terms of applications, and a prerequisite for overfitting phenomena. Averages over the\\ntraining set will be denoted as ( ... ) b; averages over all possible input vectors E {-I, I}N\\nas ( ... )e. We analyze two classes of learning rules, of the form J (? + 1) = J (?) + f).J (?):\\n\\nGaussian weight noise:\\n\\ne\\n\\ne\\n\\ne\\n\\nHe\\n\\ne\\n\\n= 11 {e(?) 9 [J(?)?e(?), B(?)?e(?)] - ,J(?) }\\nf).J(?) = 11 {(e 9 [J(?)?e, B?eDl> - ,J(m) }\\n\\non-line:\\n\\nf).J(?)\\n\\nbatch :\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nIn on-line learning one draws at each step ? a question/answer pair (e (?), B (?)) at random from the training set. In batch learning one iterates a deterministic map which is an\\naverage over all data in the training set.

As in the noise-free formalism [7], the large a approximation appears to\\ncapture the dominant terms both for a -7 00 and for a -7 O. The predicting power of our\\ntheory is mainly limited by numerical constraints. For instance, the Adatron learning rule\\ngenerates singularities at x = 0 in the distributions P?[xly) (especially for small \\\"I) which,\\nalthough predicted by our theory, are almost impossible to capture in numerical solutions.\\n\\n8 Discussion\\nWe have shown how a recent theory to describe the dynamics of supervised learning with\\nrestricted training sets (designed to apply in the data recycling regime, and for arbitrary online and batch learning rules) [5, 6, 7] in large layered neural networks can be generalized\\nsuccessfully in order to deal also with noisy teachers. In our generalized approach the joint\\ndistribution P[x, y, z) for the fields of student, 'clean' teacher, and noisy teacher is taken to\\nbe a dynamical order parameter, in addition to the conventional observables Q and R. From\\nthe order parameter set {Q, R, P} we derive the generalization error Eg and the training\\nerror E t . Following the prescriptions of dynamical replica theory one finds a diffusion\\nequation for P[x, y, z], which we have evaluated by making the replica-symmetric ansatz.\\nWe have carried out several orthogonal benchmark tests of our theory: (i) for a -7 00 (no\\ndata recycling) our theory is exact, (ii) for A -7 0 (no teacher noise) our theory reduces\\nto that of [5, 6, 7], and (iii) for batch Hebbian learning our theory is exact. For on-line\\nHebbian learning our theory is exact with regard to the predictions for Q, R, Eg and the\\ny-dependent conditional averages Jdx xP?[xly), at any time, and a crude approximation\\nof our equations already gives reasonable agreement with the exact results [9] for E t . For\\nnon-linear learning rules (Perceptron and Adatron) we have compared numerical solution\\nof a simple large a aproximation of our equations to numerical simulations, and found\\nsatisfactory agreement. This paper is a preliminary presentation of results obtained in the\\nsecond stage of a research programme aimed at extending our theoretical tools in the arena\\nof learning dynamics, building on [5, 6, 7]. Ongoing work is aimed at systematic application of our theory and its approximations to various types of non-linear learning rules, and\\nat generalization of the theory to multi-layer networks.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1]\\n[2]\\n[3]\\n[4]\\n[5]\\n[6]\\n[7]\\n[8]\\n[9]\\n[10]\\n[11]\\n[12]\\n\\nMace C.W.H. and Coolen AC.C (1998), Statistics and Computing 8, 55\\nSaad D.

On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and conscious,\\nvoluntary action as well as for brain-machine interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients,\\nimplanted with intracranial depth microelectrodes or subdural grid electrodes for\\nclinical purposes, participated in a ?matching-pennies? game against an opponent.\\nIn each trial, subjects were given a 5 s countdown, after which they had to raise\\ntheir left or right hand immediately as the ?go? signal appeared on a computer\\nscreen. They won a fixed amount of money if they raised a different hand than\\ntheir opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question we here studied was\\nthe extent to which neural precursors of the subjects? decisions can be detected in\\nintracranial local field potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action.\\nWe found that combined low-frequency (0.1?5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes\\nwere predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before the onset of the\\ngo signal. Our ORT system predicted which hand the patient would raise 0.5 s\\nbefore the go signal with 68?3% accuracy in two patients. Based on these results,\\nwe constructed an ORT system that tracked up to 30 electrodes simultaneously,\\nand tested it on retrospective data from 7 patients. On average, we could predict\\nthe correct hand choice in 83% of the trials, which rose to 92% if we let the system\\ndrop 3/10 of the trials on which it was less confident. Our system demonstrates?\\nfor the first time?the feasibility of accurately predicting a binary action on single\\ntrials in real time for patients with intracranial recordings, well before the action\\noccurs.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\f1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe work of Benjamin Libet [1, 2] and others [3, 4] has challenged our intuitive notions of the relation between decision making and conscious voluntary action. Using electrocorticography (EEG),\\nthese experiments measured brain potentials from subjects that were instructed to flex their wrist at a\\ntime of their choice and note the position of a rotating dot on a clock when they felt the urge to move.\\nThe results suggested that a slow cortical wave measured over motor areas?termed ?readiness potential? [5], and known to precede voluntary movement [6]?begins a few hundred milliseconds before the average reported time of the subjective ?urge? to move. This suggested that action onset and\\ncontents could be decoded from preparatory motor signals in the brain before the subject becomes\\naware of an intention to move and of the contents of the action. However, the readiness potential\\nwas computed by averaging over 40 or more trials aligned to movement onset after the fact. More\\nrecently, it was shown that action contents can be decoded using functional magnetic-resonance\\nimaging (fMRI) several seconds before movement onset [7]. But, while done on a single-trial basis,\\ndecoding the neural signals took place off-line, after the experiment was concluded, as the sluggish\\nnature of fMRI hemodynamic signals precluded real-time analysis. Moreover, the above studies\\nfocused on arbitrary and meaningless action?purposelessly raising the left or right hand?while\\nwe wanted to investigate prediction of reasoned action in more realistic, everyday situations with\\nconsequences for the subject.\\nIntracranial recordings are good candidates for single-trial, ORT analysis of action onset and contents [8, 9], because of the tight temporal pairing of LFP to the underlying neuronal signals. Moreover, such recordings are known to be cleaner and more robust, with signal-to-noise ratios up to\\n100 times larger than surface recordings like EEG [10, 11]. We therefore took advantage of a rare\\nopportunity to work with epilepsy patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical purposes. Our ORT system (Fig. 1) predicts, with far above chance accuracy, which one of two future\\nactions is about to occur on this one trial and feeds the prediction back to the experimenter, all\\nbefore the onset of the go signal that triggers the patient?s movement (see Experimental Methods).\\nWe achieve relatively high prediction performance using only part of the data?learning from brain\\nactivity in past trials only (Fig. 2) to predict future ones (Fig. 3)?while still running the analysis\\nquickly enough to act upon the prediction before the subject moved.\\n\\n2\\n2.1\\n\\nExperimental Methods\\nSubjects\\n\\nSubjects in this experiment were 8 consenting intractable epilepsy patients that were implanted with\\nintracranial electrodes as part of their presurgical clinical evaluation (ages 18?60, 3 males). They\\nwere inpatients in the neuro-telemetry ward at the Cedars Sinai Medical Center or the Huntington\\nMemorial Hospital, and are designated with CS or HMH after their patient numbers, respectively. Six\\nof them?P12CS, P15CS, P22CS and P29?31HMH were implanted with intracortical depth electrodes targeting their bilateral anterior-cingulate cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and orbitofrontal\\ncortex. These electrodes had eight 40 ?m microwires at their tips, 7 for recording and 1 serving as\\na local ground. Two patients, P15CS and P22CS, had additional microwires in the supplementary\\nmotor area. We utilized the LFP recorded from the microwires in this study. Two other patients,\\nP16CS and P19CS, were implanted with an 8?8 subdural grid (64 electrodes) over parts of their\\ntemporal and prefrontal dorsolateral cortices. The data of one patient?P31HMH?was excluded\\nbecause microwire signals were too noisy for meaningful analysis. The institutional review boards\\nof Cedars Sinai Medical Center, the Huntington Memorial Hospital and the California Institute of\\nTechnology approved the experiments.\\nDuring the experiment, the subject sat in a hospital bed in a semi-inclined ?lounge chair? position.\\nThe stimulus/analysis computer (bottom left of Fig. 4) displaying the game screen (bottom right\\ninset of Fig. 4) was positioned to be easily viewable for the subject. When playing against the\\nexperimenter, the latter sat beside the bed. The response box was placed within easy reach of the\\nsubject (Fig. 4).\\n2\\n\\n\\f2.2\\n\\nExperiment Design\\n\\nAs part of our focus on purposeful, reasoned action, we had the subjects play a matching-pennies\\ngame?a 2-choice version of ?rock paper scissors??either against the experimenter or against a\\ncomputer. The subjects pressed down a button with their left hand and another with their right on a\\nresponse box. Then, in each trial, there was a 5 s countdown followed by a go signal, after which\\nthey had to immediately lift one of their hands. It was agreed beforehand that the patient would win\\nthe trial if she lifted a different hand than her opponent, and lose if she raised the same hand as her\\nopponent. Both players started off with a fixed amount of money, $5, and in each trial $0.10 was\\ndeducted from the loser and awarded to the winner. If a player lifted her hand before the go signal,\\ndid not lift her hand within 500 ms of the go signal, or lifted no hand or both hands at the go signal?\\nan error trial?she lost $0.10 without her opponent gaining any money. The subjects were shown the\\ncountdown, the go signal, the overall score, and various instructions on a stimulus computer placed\\nbefore them (Fig. 4). Each game consisted of 50 trials. If, at the end of the game, the subject had\\nmore money than her opponent, she received that money in cash from the experimenter.\\nBefore the experimental session began, the experimenter explained the rules of the game to the subject, and she could practice playing the game until she was familiar with it. Consequently, patients\\nusually made only few errors during the games (<6% of the trials). Following the tutorial, the subject played 1?3 games against the computer and then once against the experimenter, depending on\\ntheir availability and clinical circumstances. The first 2 games of P12CS were removed because\\nthe subject tended to constantly raise the right hand regardless of winning or losing. Two patients,\\nP15CS and P19CS, were tested in actual ORT conditions. In such sessions?3 games each?the\\nsubjects always played against the experimenter. These ORT games were different from the other\\ngames in two respects. First, a computer screen was placed behind the patient, in a location where\\nshe could not see it. Second, the experimenter was wearing earphones (Fig. 1,4). Half a second before go-signal onset, an arrow pointing towards the hand that the system predicted the experimenter\\nhad to raise to win the trial was displayed on that screen. Simultaneously, a monophonic tone was\\nplayed in the experimenter?s earphone ipsilateral to that hand. The experimenter then lifted that hand\\nat the go signal (see Supplemental Movie).\\n\\nCheetah Machine\\nCollect\\nand save\\ndata\\n\\nPatient\\nwith intracranial electrodes\\n\\nDown\\nsampling\\n\\nBuffer\\n\\n1Gbps\\nRouter\\n\\nTTL Signal\\n\\nThe winner is\\nPlayer 1\\nPLAYER 1 PLAYER 2\\nSCORE 1\\n\\nAnalysis/stimulus machine\\n\\nSCORE 2\\n\\nResponse Box Game Screen\\n\\n/\\nExperimenter\\n\\nResult\\nInterpreta\\ntion\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nFiltering\\n\\nDisplay/Sound\\n\\nFigure 1: A schematic diagram of the on-line real-time (ORT) system.

This computer first band-pass-filtered the\\ndata to the 0.1?5 Hz range (delta and lower theta bands) using a second-order zero-lag elliptic\\nfilter with an attenuation of 40 dB (cf. Figs. 2a and 2b). We found that this frequency range?\\ngenerally comparable to that of the readiness potential?resulted in optimal prediction performance.\\nIt then ran the analysis algorithm (see below) on the filtered data. This computer also controlled\\nthe game screen, displaying the names of the players, their current scores and various instructions.\\nThe analysis/stimulus computer further\\ncontrolled the response box, which con- (a)\\n800\\nsisted of 4 LED-lit buttons.

The training phase included the first 70% of the\\ntrials, with the prediction carried out on\\nthe remaining 30% using the trained parameters, together with an online weighting system (see below). The system examined only neural activity, and had no\\naccess to the subject?s left/right-choice\\nhistory.

A new signal?from 5 to 0.5 seconds before the\\ngo signal?is received in real time, and each electrode/time-window/classifier combination (ETC)\\nclassifies it as resulting in left- or right-hand movement. These predictions are then compared to the\\nactual hand movement, with the weights associated with ETCs that correctly (incorrectly) predicted\\nincreasing (decreasing).\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nComputing optimal left/right-separating time windows\\n\\nThe algorithm focused on finding the time windows with the best left/right separation for the different recording electrodes over the training set (Fig. 2c?e). That is, we wanted to predict whether\\nthe signal aN (t) on trial N will result in a leftward or rightward movement?i.e., whether the label of the N th trial will be Lt or Rt, respectively. For each electrode, we looked at the N ? 1\\nprevious trials a1 (t), a2 (t), . . . , aN ?1 (t), and their associated labels as l1 , l2 , . . . , lN ?1 . Now, let\\nN ?1\\n?1\\nL(t) = {ai (t) | li = Lt}N\\ni=1 and R(t) = {ai (t) | li = Rt}i=1 be the set of previous leftward and\\nrightward trials in the training set, respectively. Furthermore, let Lm (t) (Rm (t)) and Ls (t) (Rs (t))\\nbe the mean and standard error of L(t) (R(t)), respectively. We can now define the normalized\\nrelative left/right separation for each electrode at time t (see Fig. 2d):\\n?\\n[Lm (t) ? Ls (t)] ? [Rm (t) + Rs (t)]\\n?\\n?\\nif [Lm (t) ? Ls (t)] ? [Rm (t) + Rs (t)] > 0\\n?\\n?\\nLm (t) ? Rm (t)\\n?\\n?\\n?\\n?\\n?\\n[Rm (t) ? Rs (t)] ? [Lm (t) + Ls (t)]\\n?(t) =\\n?\\nif [Rm (t) ? Rs (t)] ? [Lm (t) + Ls (t)] > 0\\n?\\n?\\n?\\nRm (t) ? Lm (t)\\n?\\n?\\n?\\n?\\n?\\n?\\n0\\notherwise\\nThus, ?(t) > 0 (?(t) < 0) means that the leftward trials tend to be considerably higher (lower)\\nthan rightward trials for that electrode at time t, while ?(t) = 0 suggests no left/right separation at\\ntime t. We define a consecutive time period of |?(t)| > 0 for t < prediction time (the time before\\nthe go signal when we want the system to output a prediction; -0.5 s for the ORT trials) as a time\\nwindow (Fig. 2e). After all time windows are found for all electrodes, time windows lessRthan M ms\\nt\\napart are combined into one. Then, for each time window from t1 to t2 we define a = t12 |?(t)|dt.\\nWe then eliminate all time windows satisfying a < A. We found the values M = 200 ms and\\nA = 4, 500 ?V ? ms to be optimal for real-time analysis. This resulted in 20?30 time windows over\\nall 64 electrodes that we monitored.\\n5\\n\\n\\f1\\n$4.80\\n\\n$5.20\\n\\nP15CS\\n\\nUri\\n\\nFigure 4: The experimental setup in the clinic.

The realtime system already\\ncomputed a prediction, and thus displays an arrow on the screen behind the patient and plays a tone\\nin the experimenter?s ear ipsilateral to the hand it predicts he should raise to beat the patient (see\\nSupplemental Movie).\\n3.3\\n\\nClassifiers selection and ETC determination\\n\\nWe used ensemble learning with 7 types of relatively simple binary classifiers (due to real-time\\nprocessing considerations) on every electrode?s time windows (Fig. 2f). Classifiers A to G would\\nclassify aN (t) as Lt if:\\nP\\nP\\nP\\n(A) Defining aN,M , Lm,M and Rm,M as aN (t), Lm (t) and Rm (t) over time window M ,\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\n(i) sign Rm,M 6= sign aN,M = sign Lm,M , or\\n\\f\\n\\f\\n\\f \\f\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\n(ii) sign Rm,M = sign aN,M = sign Lm,M and \\fLm,M \\f > \\fRm,M \\f, or\\n\\f\\n\\f\\n\\f \\f\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\n(iii) sign Rm (t) 6= sign SN,M 6= sign Lm (t) and \\fLm,M \\f < \\fRm,M \\f;\\n\\f\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\f \\f\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\f\\n(B) \\fmean aN (t) ? mean Lm (t) \\f < \\fmean aN (t) ? mean Rm (t) \\f;\\n\\f\\n\\f\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\f\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\f\\n(C) \\fmedian aN (t) ? median Lm (t) \\f < \\fmedian aN (t) ? median Rm (t) \\f over the time\\nwindow;\\n\\f\\n\\f\\n\\f\\n\\f\\n\\f\\n(D) aN (t) ?

Rm (t)\\fL2 over the time window;\\n(E) aN (t) is convex/concave like Lm (t) while Rm (t) is concave/convex, respectively;\\n(F) Linear support-vector machine (SVM) designates it as so; and\\n(G) k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with Euclidean distance designates it as so.\\nEach classifier is optimized for certain types of features. To estimate how well its classification\\nwould generalize from the training to the test set, we trained and tested it using a 70/30 crossvalidation procedure within the training set. We tested each classifier on every time window of every\\nelectrode, discarding those with accuracy <0.68, which left 12.0 ? 1.6% of the original 232 ? 18\\nETCs, on average (?standard error). The training phase therefore ultimately output a set of S binary\\nETC combinations (Fig. 2g) that were used in the prediction phase (Fig. 3).\\n3.4\\n\\nThe prediction-phase weighting system\\n\\nIn the prediction phase, each of the overall S binary ETCs calculates a prediction, ci ? {?1, 1} (for\\nright and left, respectively), independently at the desired prediction time. All classifiers are initially\\n6\\n\\n\\fPS\\ngiven the same weight, w1 = w2 = ? ? ? = wS = 1. We then calculate ? = i=1 wi ? ci and predict\\nleft (right) if ? > d (? < ?d), or declare it an undetermined trial if ?d < ? < d. Here d is the\\ndrop-off threshold for the prediction. Thus the larger d is, the more confident the system needs to be\\nto make a prediction, and the larger the proportion of trials on which the system abstains?the dropoff rate. Weight wi associated with ETCi is increased (decreased) by 0.1 whenever ETCi predicts\\nthe hand movement correctly (incorrectly). A constantly erring ETC would therefore be associated\\nwith an increasingly small and then increasingly negative weight.\\n3.5\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nThe algorithm was implemented in MATLAB 2011a (MathWorks, Natick, MA) as well as in C++\\non Visual Studio 2008 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for enhanced performance. The neural signals\\nwere collected by the Digital Lynx S system using Cheetah 5.4.0 (Neuralynx, Redmond, WA). The\\nsimulated-ORT system was also implemented in MATLAB 2011a. The simulated-ORT analyses\\ncarried out in this paper used real patient data saved on the Digital Lynx system.\\n1\\n\\n0.9\\n\\nDrop rate:\\nNone\\n0.18\\n0\\u0011\\u0016\\u0013\\n\\nPrediction accuracy\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n0.7\\nSignificant accuracy\\n(p=0.05)\\n0.6\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n?5\\n\\n?4.5\\n\\n?4\\n\\n?3.5\\n\\n?3\\n\\n?2.5\\nTime (s)\\n\\n?2\\n\\n?1.5\\n\\n?1\\n\\n?0.5\\n\\n0\\nGo-signal\\nonset\\n\\nFigure 5: Across-subjects average of the prediction accuracy of simulated-ORT versus time before\\nthe go signal.

Values above the dashed horizontal line are significant at p = 0.05.\\n\\n4\\n\\nResults\\n\\nWe tested our prediction system in actual real time on 2 patients?P15CS and P19CS (a depth\\nand grid patient, respectively), with a prediction time of 0.5 s before the go signal (see Supplementary Movie). Because of computational limitations, the ORT system could only track 10\\nelectrodes with just 1 ETC per electrode in real time. For P15CS, we achieved an accuracy of\\n72?2% (?standard error; accuracy = number of accurately predicted trials / [total number of trials - number of dropped trials]; p = 10?8 , binomial test) without modifying the weights online during the prediction (see Section 3.4). For P19CS we did not run patient-specific training of the ORT system, and used parameter values that were good on average over previous patients instead. The prediction accuracy was significantly above chance 63?2% (?standard error; p = 7 ? 10?4 , binomial test). To understand how much we could improve our accuracy\\nwith optimized hardware/software, we ran the simulated-ORT at various prediction times along\\n7\\n\\n\\fAccuracy\\n\\nthe 5 s countdown leading to the go signal. We further tested 3 drop-off rates?0, 0.19 and\\n0.30 (Fig. 5; drop-off rate = number of dropped trials / total number of trials; these resulted\\nfrom 3 drop-off thresholds?0, 0.1 and 0.2?respectively, see Section 3.4:). Running offline,\\nwe were able to track 20?30 ETCs, which resulted in considerably higher accuracies (Figs. 5,6).\\nAveraged over all subjects, the accuracy rose from about 65% more than\\n1\\n4 s before the go signal to 83?92%\\nclose to go-signal onset, depending\\n0.9\\non the allowed drop-off rate. In particular, we found that for a predic0.8\\ntion time of 0.5 s before go-signal\\nonset, we could achieve accuracies\\n0.7\\nof 81?5% and 90?3% (?standard\\nerror) for P15CS and P19CS, re0.6\\nspectively, with no drop off (Fig. 6).\\nPatients:\\nP12CS\\nWe also analyzed the weights that\\nP15CS\\nour weighting system assigned to the\\n0.5\\nP16CS\\nP19CS\\ndifferent ETCs. We found that the\\nP22CS\\nempirical distribution of weights to\\nP29HMH\\n0.4\\nP30HMH\\nETCs associated with classifiers A to\\nG was, on average: 0.15, 0.12, 0.16,\\n?5 ?4.5 ?4 ?3.5 ?3 ?2.5 ?2 ?1.5 ?1 ?0.5 0\\n0.22, 0.01, 0.26 and 0.07, respecTime before go signal (at t=0) (seconds)\\ntively. This suggests that the linear\\nSVM and L2-norm comparisons (of\\naN to Lm and Rm ) together make up Figure 6: Simulated-ORT accuracy over time for individual\\nnearly half of the overall weights at- patients with no drop off.\\ntributed to the classifiers, while the\\ncurrent concave/convex measure is of\\nlittle use as a classifier.\\n\\n5\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWe constructed an ORT system that, based on intracranial recordings, predicted which hand a person would raise well before movement onset at accuracies much greater than chance in a competitive environment. We further tested this system off-line, which suggested that with optimized\\nhardware/software, such action contents would be predictable in real time at relatively high accuracies already several seconds before movement onset. Both our prediction accuracy and drop-off\\nrates close to movement onset are superior to those achieved before movement onset with noninvasive methods like EEG and fMRI [7, 12?14]. Importantly, our subjects played a matching pennies game?a 2-choice version of rock-paper-scissors [15]?to keep their task realistic, with minor\\nthough real consequences, unlike the Libet-type paradigms whose outcome bears no consequences\\nfor the subjects. It was suggested that accurate online, real-time prediction before movement onset\\nis key to investigating the relation between the neural correlates of decisions, their awareness, and\\nvoluntary action [16, 17]. Such prediction capabilities would facilitate many types of experiments\\nthat are currently infeasible. For example, it would make it possible to study decision reversals on\\na single-trial basis, or to test whether subjects can guess above chance which of their action contents are predictable from their current brain activity, potentially before having consciously made up\\ntheir mind [16, 18]. Accurately decoding these preparatory motor signals may also result in earlier\\nand improved classification for brain-computer interfaces [13, 19, 20]. The work we present here\\nsuggests that such ORT analysis might well be possible.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Ueli Rutishauser, Regan Blythe Towel, Liad Mudrik and Ralph Adolphs for meaningful\\ndiscussions.
