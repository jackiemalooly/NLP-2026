    "\n",
    "In **spaCy**, tokenization is performed using language-specific grammatical rules. For example:  \n",

    "- Abbreviations like **\"U.K.\"** retain their periods within a single token.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- The **input** to the tokenizer is a **Unicode text**.  \n",
    "- The **output** is a **Doc object**, which consists of individual tokens.  \n",
    "- We can **iterate** over tokens and access attributes such as `token.text`.  \n",
    "- spaCy's tokenizer is **non-destructive**, meaning it preserves the original text while providing structured access to tokens.  \n",

    "  In sentiment analysis, words like **articles** (e.g., *\"the\"*, *\"a\"*) and **pronouns** (e.g., *\"he\"*, *\"she\"*) might be discarded because they contribute little to the overall sentiment of the text.\n",

    "Dependency parsing involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence and establishing relationships between **head** words and their **modifiers**.

    "For instance, in the phrase **\"flight to Denver\"**, the noun *Denver* modifies the meaning of *flight*. This creates a **dependency** where:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Flight* is the **head** (governing word).  \n",
    "- *Denver* is the **dependent** (child node).  \n",
    "- This relationship is marked by the **nmod** (nominal modifier) tag, indicating that *Denver* provides additional information about *flight*.  \n",

    "## 6. Subword Tokenization  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sentence into smaller units, enabling AI models to process text as discrete tokens rather than as a continuous block of text. In previous sections, you have used spaCy for tokenization, which primarily segments text into individual words. While this approach is efficient, it struggles with handling uncommon or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, modern tokenization techniques predominantly use **subword-based methods**. Instead of strictly segmenting text into words, these approaches break words into smaller subword units when necessary. For example, the word *unhappiness* might be tokenized into *un* and *happiness*. This strategy offers several advantages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Handling of Rare Words** – By decomposing words into meaningful subunits, the model can recognize and generate words that were not explicitly seen during training.  \n",
    "- **Compact Vocabulary** – Instead of storing an extensive vocabulary of all possible words, subword tokenization relies on a smaller set of subunits, which can be combined to form complex words.  \n",
    "- **Efficient Representation** – By balancing whole-word tokens with subword segments, this method optimizes both memory usage and model performance.  \n",
    "\n",

    "**Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** is also another subword tokenization technique used in models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) and other transformer-based architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Byte-Level BPE Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of treating text as sequences of **Unicode characters** (such as 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.), **byte-level BPE** tokenizes text at the **byte level**. Each character, word, and symbol is first converted into its corresponding **byte representation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **base vocabulary** for byte-level BPE is much smaller, consisting of only **256 byte values**, as there are 256 possible byte values. This ensures that any character can be represented without needing to resort to an **unknown token** for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows models like **GPT-2** and **RoBERTa** to handle any character or symbol, including those from different languages, special symbols, or rare characters, without needing additional vocabularies or dealing with OOV issues.\n",
